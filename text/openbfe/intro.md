<p>Open source is a philosophy of building software where the code is designed to be publicly and freely available. Here at BfE, we believe that the software we build can go beyond our work and potentially benefit the wider community. OpenBfE is thus our own program to make that vision a reality, to share technological innovations and contribute to the open source community.</p>
<p>The projects you see here were all created by our team of volunteers here at BfE. Patches are always welcome!</p>
