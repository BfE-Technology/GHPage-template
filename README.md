# BfE-theme

Welcome to your new Jekyll theme! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your theme into a gem. Put your layouts in `_layouts`, your includes in `_includes` and any other assets in `assets`.

To experiment with this code, add some sample content and run `docker compose up` â€“ this directory is setup just like a Jekyll site!

TODO: Delete this and the text above, and describe your gem
