# Customisation

## Variables Configuration

In `index.md`, there are two configurable variables where you could set the parameters according to your preferences:
```yml
layout: ["main-layout" or "tech-layout" (unquoted) to indicate page header style]
navbar: ["true" or "false" (unquoted) to indicate whether to show navigation bar]
```

If you would like to add your custom styles, include your `.css` file into the `/assets/css` directory.
